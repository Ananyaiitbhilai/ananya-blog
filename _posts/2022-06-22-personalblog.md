Hey! Here I am writing a personal Blog. And not only writing a blog but also writing it in a markdown file, particularly deploying a jekyll website just for a personal blog, I could have written this blog in motes app on my laptop rather that putting all these efforts but I wanted to put some effort to write this blog and hence this jekyll website. I was thinking about this(blogging, personal website) since past 1 month. 

I won't be describing who I am since the purpose of this website is solely for my personal writing and as of now my plan is to keep it to me only. I won't be sharing link of this website with my parents, boyfriend, friends, etc. currently.

What makes me write a blog today? Well, I am having a lot of thoughts in my mind and I guess a self-introspection was needed, and in this case whats better than writing a blog. Since no one else is going to have link to this blog, I believe I would be honest to myself and try ton write the things that I have kept in my ming only till now and never spoke about them.

My vacations are going on and I have got much work to do. Tomorrow I have my gsoc meeting with mentors and I have to write that blog too. I wanted to try sphinx for that but will try later on. I will be spending atmost 40 mins for writing this blog. I will write a blog about my gsoc journey till now tomorrow night prolly since I have a lot to tell on that part too. The blog I am writing now is related to my personal life and my feelings/intutions.

I am in college and in a relationship too. The person I am dating is nice, ig gentle, well-spoken, polite,intelligent, someone whom everyone likes sort of. As a person all these qualities are good to have, but when one is in a relationship there is more to that. Why am I in a relationship? Well initially, It all went in a flow and on a very fast pace. But what I conclude right now is that I believe that it is necessary for one to discuss things, thoughts about any topic be it related to any course, or any movie or any person. You need a person exclusively for you who can admire you, help you take right decision, take care about you, remind you. And especially when you are far away from home it feels somewhat safe and secure to have someone whom you can trust very much and confinde in. In college, handling pressure alone is very difficult, that is what I feel, a person exclusively for you, one who admires you, and is wise is what you need. 

In my relationship there were/are many rough patches too- 2 times almost break-up.
My boyfriend told me today that he doesn't want to tell me all the things for whatever reason. I understand his point but this not what I want in my boyfriend. I want a man who listens to me patiently and tells me about all the things happening in his life. Currently, I was pretty much sure that I used to force my boyfriend to tell me all the things by constantly asking and constantly pinging and he agreed too that I force him to tell the things. Its not just happening here that I am forcing him, there are many other instances also, for e.g. If I had send him any picture of mine, I have to tell him to react or ask how do I look? what I expect from my bf is to give some lovely comments without asking him again and again. I want him to say me nice things, things that make me feel loved but again I have to ask him for that, but this should not be the case rather He should do that on his own. I feel I put way more efforts than he does. I feel this also that I am the one who messages first, waiting for his replies. I am the one mostly crying. I am the one always talking and being ignored. From his gestures or texts, it seems everything is forced. I don't feel admired, I don't feel loved. 

But then I am the one who doesn't want to end the relationship. I love that guy very much but this is not what I seek in a relationship. Things being forced all the time.

I get angry at the silliest of the things but I try to control my anger and I believe I have reduced the intensity of anger to some extent and I have learnt to apologise too.

Today I don't know where will this relationship go bcz I tried not to but still I have felt so unloved and felt being ignored from him that I have lost a tiny fraction of feeling for him. Earlier, it was never like this even when we almost broke up.

Idk what happened but possible reasons I am guessing are constantly forcing him to say/do/tell things, he not being interested on his own, him not taking initiative to talk or message, firing back the question i asked on me all the time, not answeing my question, replying with "hmm.., idk", not addressing issues. One more thing i feel is that one other friend of mine gives me much attention, listens to me patiently and for hours too, answers all my wierd questions. He makes me feel desired. Maybe because of this I might have set some threshold set that atleast this much attention I should get from my bf. 

As the time is passing, I feel more of this and eventually god knows what will happen with this relationship but I don't want to let it go this way. Idk how long I will be able to handle this. 

In jan'22, when he almost broke up with me, my other friend confessed that he has feelings for me. But idk, Since I loved the guy so much I couldn't let him go. I cried and whatever it was in him whether sympathy or love, he got back with me. I asked him a question- Whom would you have chosen if you were me? And he said he would have not choosen himself but the other guy. I find my bf wise enough. 


I am not blaming anyone but this is what I feel and what I seek for.
